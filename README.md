## Project Overview
LeafLens is developed to **assist farmers and gardeners** in identifying plant leaf diseases at an early stage. Traditionally, manual inspection is time-consuming and requires expertise. LeafLens automates this process using a **CNN-based classifier**, allowing rapid and accurate detection of multiple leaf diseases. 🌿🧠

---

## Features ✨
- Detects and classifies multiple **plant leaf diseases**.  
- Fully implemented in **Python** using standard libraries.  
- **Preprocessing pipeline** ensures clean and consistent image input.  
- Enables **early intervention** to prevent crop loss.  
- Provides a foundation for **smart farming solutions**.  

---

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Programming Language:** Python    
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git & GitHub  

---

## Dataset 📂
- Dataset consists of **images of healthy and diseased leaves**.  
- Can use **PlantVillage dataset** or custom collected images.  
- Images are preprocessed (resized, normalized) before training.  

---

## Installation 💻
1. Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/LeafLens.git
```


## Navigate to the project folder
```bash
cd LeafLens
```

## Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🚀
1). Place leaf images in the dataset folder.
2). Run the Python script:
```bash
python main.py
```
3). The system will classify the leaf as healthy or diseased and display results.
4). (Optional) Visualizations of predictions can be generated using Matplotlib.


## Results 📊
1). High classification accuracy achieved using CNN architecture.
2). Can detect common leaf diseases like blight, rust, mildew, and spot diseases.
3). Early detection allows faster treatment and better crop yield.
